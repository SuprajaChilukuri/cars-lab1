  			<th>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), is a German multinational company which produces luxury vehicles and motorcycles. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.

            The company has significant motorsport history, especially in touring cars, Formula 1, sports cars and the Isle of Man TT.

            BMW serves purely as a status symbol for some, while for others it's a belief in the mantra “The Ultimate Driving Machine” and philosophy of high revving engines. With that in mind, some are not only attracted to the BMW brand just because they produce great cars, but also because of their way of doing things.</th>
